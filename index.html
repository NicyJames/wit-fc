            Take hold of instruction, do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life.” “Wisdom strengthens the wise more<br> than ten rulers of the city.” “We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.”
            Who is <b>JESUS</b><i>Christ</i>Jesus Christ? Jesus is the Holy Son of God. He is the Way the Truth and the Light. <br>He came to earth to be a witness for his Father's Love and to teach Forgiveness. The name Jesus brings associations <br>such as Peace, Miracles, Love and Healing. His healing scriptures were full of parables and stories which helped those with the ears to hear to understand what he wanted to say about God and about the nature of our Salvation. God has many helpers, but Jesus the Christ is for you the bearer of Christ's single healing scripture of the Love of God. You need no other. It is possible to read his words and benefit from them without accepting him into your life. Yet he would help you but a little more if you will share your pains and joys with him, and leave them both to find the peace of God. Yet still it is his lesson most of all that he would have you learn, and it is this: There is no death because the Son of God is like his Father. Nothing you can do can change Eternal Love. Forget your dreams of sin and guilt, and come with Him instead to share the resurrection of God's Son. And bring with you all those whom He has sent to you to care for as Jesus cares for you. This sacred Son of God is like yourself; the mirror of his Father's Love for you, the soft reminder of the Love of God by which he was created and which still abides in him as it abides in you.
